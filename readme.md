# Task Lists App

The Task Lists app is a simple android project. It allows the user to manage their day-by-day task report. This whole project has only one concept, that to record your daily task and to-do lists. You will add a task and also edit it. Also, you can reset all your task lists or simply delete any one of the tasks from the list.
